1 The memo was delivered in May 2011 ; Mansoor Ijaz wrote a Financial Times article in October 2011 bringing initial public attention to the affair .
2 The memo , which at first was questioned to even exist , was published in November , leading to the resignation of Ambassador Haqqani and the continuing Pakistani Supreme Court investigation .
3 Central actors in the plot include Pakistani - American businessman Mansoor Ijaz , who alleged that long - time friend and former Pakistan Ambassador to the United States Husain Haqqani asked him to deliver a confidential memo asking for US assistance .
4 The memo is alleged to have been drafted by Haqqani at the behest of President of Pakistan Asif Ali Zardari .
5 The memo was delivered to Mike Mullen through then National Security Advisor James L. Jones .
6 The Supreme Court of Pakistan has opened a broader inquiry into the origins , credibility and purpose of the memo .
7 On 19 April 2012 a petition was submitted in the Supreme Court to arrest former Pakistan ambassador to US Husain Haqqani through Interpol for his refusal to return to Pakistan .
8 On 12 June the supreme court commission released its findings and found that after testimony by all parties and verifying the forensic results of Ijaz 's BlackBerry conversations with Haqqani it was " incontrovertibly established " that Husain Haqqani had written the memo and was being called back to Pakistan to face likely charges of treason .

##title Live in New York (Laurie Anderson album)
0 Live in New York was a 2-CD live album released by performance artist Laurie Anderson on Nonesuch Records in 2002 .
1 It was her ninth album of new recordings released since 1982 .
2 The front cover of the CD has the title Live at Town Hall , New York City September 19–20 , 2001 , however the official title of the album is just Live in New York .
3 Recorded less than 10 days after the September 11 , 2001 , attacks on New York City , the album was produced during a tour Anderson gave of the United States in which she performed a mixture of older pieces from earlier in her career and newer works , including songs from her then - recent album Life on a String , as well as earlier albums such as United States Live , Big Science , Bright Red , Home of the Brave and Strange Angels .
4 Following so close to the attacks , Anderson makes several statements about them in her recognizable style .
5 The performance is highlighted by a performance of " O Superman , " the song that launched Anderson to stardom in 1981 and that contains lyrics that can — in retrospect — be seen to relate to the terrorist attacks .
6 One song , " Progress " , is a retitled performance of the song " The Dream Before " which Anderson debuted in her 1986 short film What You Mean We ?
7 and later featured on Strange Angels .

##title Paul Morphy
0 Paul Charles Morphy ( June 22 , 1837   – July 10 , 1884 ) was an American chess player .
1 He is considered to have been the greatest chess master of his era and an unofficial World Chess Champion .
2 A chess prodigy , he was called " The Pride and Sorrow of Chess " because he had a brilliant chess career but retired from the game while still young .
3 Bobby Fischer ranked him among the ten greatest players of all time , and described him as " perhaps the most accurate player who ever lived " .
4 Morphy was born in New Orleans to a wealthy and distinguished family .
5 He learned to play chess by simply watching games between his father and uncle .
6 His family soon recognized the boy 's talent and encouraged him to play at family gatherings , and by the age of nine he was considered to be one of the best players in the city .
7 At just twelve years of age , Morphy defeated visiting Hungarian master Johann Löwenthal in a match of three games .
8 After receiving his degree in 1857 , Morphy was not yet of legal age to practice law and found himself with free time .
9 At his uncle 's urging , he accepted an invitation to play at the First American Chess Congress in New York City .
10 After winning the tournament , which included strong players such as Alexander Meek and Louis Paulsen , Morphy was hailed as the chess champion of the United States and stayed in New York playing chess through 1857 , winning the vast majority of his games .
11 In 1858 , Morphy traveled to Europe to play European Champion Howard Staunton .
12 Morphy played almost every strong player in Europe , usually winning easily .
13 The match with Staunton never materialized , but Morphy was acclaimed by most in Europe as the world 's best player .
14 Returning to the United States in triumph , Morphy toured the major cities playing chess on his way back to New Orleans .
15 By 1859 , on returning to New Orleans , Morphy declared he was retiring from chess to begin his law career .
16 However , Morphy was never able to establish a successful law practice and ultimately lived a life of idleness , living off his family 's fortune .
17 Despite appeals from his chess admirers , Morphy never returned to the game , and died in 1884 from a stroke at the age of 47 .

##title America's Sweetheart (album)
0 America 's Sweetheart is the debut studio album by American alternative rock musician Courtney Love , released worldwide on February 10 , 2004 by Virgin Records .
1 Her first official release after her former band Hole 's break - up , the album 's sound diverged significantly in musical and lyrical content to Hole 's three previous studio albums : Pretty on the Inside ( 1991 ) , Live Through This ( 1994 ) and Celebrity Skin ( 1998 ) .
2 The recording process of the album began in summer 2001 in Los Angeles , California , however , was affected drastically by a number of personal and legal issues by Love ; including her drug problems , the disbandment of Hole , the controversy surrounding Nirvana 's upcoming box set , and legal problems with various record labels .
3 In spring 2003 , Love traveled to southern France to re - record the album , however , according to Love , she " just wanted to be in a château for six months and do drugs . "
4 The album had three main producers , one of whom , James Barber , was Love 's partner at the time .
5 Following recording , America 's Sweetheart was further delayed due to Virgin 's excessive input on the album 's mastering , art work and design , and track listing .
6 Upon its release , it received little promotion , with the main source of media exposure being a music video for the album 's first single , " Mono , " and Love 's highly publicised drug issues .
7 America 's Sweetheart received mixed reviews and was a commercial failure , selling little over 200,000 copies in the United States , and with Love further citing the album as " a mistake . "
8 In more recent years , both Love and producer Linda Perry have referred to the album as " le disaster " and " ruined because [ Love ] was coked out , " respectively .
9 The album featured drumming from former Hole drummer Patty Schemel , as well as guest instrumentation and vocals from Emilie Autumn .
