5 Albemarle County was named in honor of Willem Anne van Keppel , 2nd Earl of Albemarle .
6 However , its most famous inhabitant was Thomas Jefferson , who built his estate home , Monticello , in the county .
Albemarle County, Virginia|0,3,4|1 Albemarle County, Charlottesville, contains administrative territorial entity, [0, 1]  （2）指代分析 Its -> Albemarle County

Albemarle County, Virginia|10,2,2|13 Albemarle, Commonwealth of Virginia, located in the administrative territorial entity, [0] （1）句内分析
为什么这个关系没能找出来？因为这个 Albemarle 在标注的过程中，标注的有问题。标注 Albemarle 这个实体是只是sentence 4和5 中的那两个实体，而不是指 Albemarle County这个实体

5 It has also been claimed the county was named for Revolutionary War soldier Ethan Allen , but the weight of the evidence in favor of John Allen led the General Assembly to declare in 1976 that the county was named for him .
6 Allen County comprises the Lima , OH Metropolitan Statistical Area , which is also part of the Lima - Van Wert - Wapakoneta , OH Combined Statistical Area .
Allen County, Ohio|5,0,79|6 Lima, Allen County, capital of, [0, 2] （2）指代分析 同上
Allen County, Ohio|0,5,70|14 Allen County, Lima, capital, [0, 2]  （2）指代分析   SSAN遗漏了
上面这两条关系其实是同一个，但是因为 The county seat is Lima.  没能知道The county 指代的是 Allen County，所以导致这个关系未能识别。

Allen County, Ohio|8,9,27|9 John Allen, Battle of Frenchtown, conflict, [4] （1）句内分析
Allen County, Ohio|12,11,27|7 Ethan Allen, Revolutionary War, conflict, [5] （1）句内分析
为什么这么简单的句内关系都没能识别出来？ => 关系表述的很隐性，就必须要通过语义才知道是这么个关系。也就是说，这个表述太多样化了，没有固定的模式，所以很难识别出来？

Allen County, Ohio|0,7,15|15 Allen County, 1831, inception, [0, 3]  （4）标签错误
因为 第2句 有The County，指代的就是 Allen County。 尽管是个错误的标签，但是也应该给出一些启示。

Allen County, Ohio|0,5,4|13 Allen County, Lima, contains administrative territorial entity, [0, 2] （8）理解语义 同上分析，The county seat 指的就是Allen County 的政府所在地

Allen F. Moore|18,3,1|25 Republican, U.S., country, [0, 6] （3）需要推导  同理，这个人被选举成了 Republican，同时这个人是美国人，所以知道这个Republican 的country是美国
Allen F. Moore|3,27,4|10 U.S., Texas, contains administrative territorial entity, [0, 9] （3）需要推导  弱关系 这个人是美国人，同时这个人后来移民到Texas，所以能说明 Texas in U.S.， 即 U.S. contains administrative terrestrial entity Texas

4 The album had three main producers , one of whom , James Barber , was Love 's partner at the time .
5 Following recording , America 's Sweetheart was further delayed due to Virgin 's excessive input on the album 's mastering , art work and design , and track listing .
6 Upon its release , it received little promotion , with the main source of media exposure being a music video for the album 's first single , " Mono , " and Love 's highly publicised drug issues .
7 America 's Sweetheart received mixed reviews and was a commercial failure , selling little over 200,000 copies in the United States , and with Love further citing the album as " a mistake . "
8 In more recent years , both Love and producer Linda Perry have referred to the album as " le disaster " and " ruined because [ Love ] was coked out , " respectively .

2 The front cover of the CD has the title Live at Town Hall , New York City September 19–20 , 2001 , however the official title of the album is just Live in New York .

4 Following so close to the attacks , Anderson makes several statements about them in her recognizable style .

1 The memo was delivered in May 2011 ; Mansoor Ijaz wrote a Financial Times article in October 2011 bringing initial public attention to the affair .
2 The memo , which at first was questioned to even exist , was published in November , leading to the resignation of Ambassador Haqqani and the continuing Pakistani Supreme Court investigation .
3 Central actors in the plot include Pakistani - American businessman Mansoor Ijaz , who alleged that long - time friend and former Pakistan Ambassador to the United States Husain Haqqani asked him to deliver a confidential memo asking for US assistance .
4 The memo is alleged to have been drafted by Haqqani at the behest of President of Pakistan Asif Ali Zardari .
5 The memo was delivered to Mike Mullen through then National Security Advisor James L. Jones .
6 The Supreme Court of Pakistan has opened a broader inquiry into the origins , credibility and purpose of the memo .
7 On 19 April 2012 a petition was submitted in the Supreme Court to arrest former Pakistan ambassador to US Husain Haqqani through Interpol for his refusal to return to Pakistan .
8 On 12 June the supreme court commission released its findings and found that after testimony by all parties and verifying the forensic results of Ijaz 's BlackBerry conversations with Haqqani it was " incontrovertibly established " that Husain Haqqani had written the memo and was being called back to Pakistan to face likely charges of treason .

0 Paul Charles Morphy ( June 22 , 1837   – July 10 , 1884 ) was an American chess player .
1 He is considered to have been the greatest chess master of his era and an unofficial World Chess Champion .
2 A chess prodigy , he was called " The Pride and Sorrow of Chess " because he had a brilliant chess career but retired from the game while still young .
3 Bobby Fischer ranked him among the ten greatest players of all time , and described him as " perhaps the most accurate player who ever lived " .
4 Morphy was born in New Orleans to a wealthy and distinguished family .
5 He learned to play chess by simply watching games between his father and uncle .
6 His family soon recognized the boy 's talent and encouraged him to play at family gatherings , and by the age of nine he was considered to be one of the best players in the city .
7 At just twelve years of age , Morphy defeated visiting Hungarian master Johann Löwenthal in a match of three games .
8 After receiving his degree in 1857 , Morphy was not yet of legal age to practice law and found himself with free time .
9 At his uncle 's urging , he accepted an invitation to play at the First American Chess Congress in New York City .
10 After winning the tournament , which included strong players such as Alexander Meek and Louis Paulsen , Morphy was hailed as the chess champion of the United States and stayed in New York playing chess through 1857 , winning the vast majority of his games .
11 In 1858 , Morphy traveled to Europe to play European Champion Howard Staunton .
12 Morphy played almost every strong player in Europe , usually winning easily .
13 The match with Staunton never materialized , but Morphy was acclaimed by most in Europe as the world 's best player .
14 Returning to the United States in triumph , Morphy toured the major cities playing chess on his way back to New Orleans .
15 By 1859 , on returning to New Orleans , Morphy declared he was retiring from chess to begin his law career .
16 However , Morphy was never able to establish a successful law practice and ultimately lived a life of idleness , living off his family 's fortune .
17 Despite appeals from his chess admirers , Morphy never returned to the game , and died in 1884 from a stroke at the age of 47 .
